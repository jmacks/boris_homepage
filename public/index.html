                        My name is Boris Patent and my medical background is extensive, working in the mental health industry since 2007, specializing
                    in ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy. I have gotten the opportunity to help dozens of families with children and young
                    adults who have special needs, primarily autism. Many of the clients I work with have com-morbid disorders such as ADHD,
                    epilepsy, OCD, depression, IED, and gastro-intestinal issues. With an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, I continued my
                    studies, working on a Masters degree in Psychology with a focus on ABA. I also have a background in occupational and physical
                    therapy, as well as behavioral optometry and reflexology. Being trained in those areas, with one-one work experience at a
                    physical and occupational therapy clinic, as well as a behavioral optometry clinic, I have extensive experience treating
                    people with motor function problems. This includes helping clients with things such as balance, sensory processing, physical
                    orientation, and mobility. My training in these areas overlap well with my training in ABA since most children and young
                    adults with special needs also struggle with physical performance. Currently, I am finishing my post-graduate work with hopes
                    of becoming a BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) by 2020. Please feel free to contact me at (847) 409-6215 for any questions
                    regarding consultation and available appointments.
